We created a webscraper to extract information regarding all of the meal offerings in UCLA's on campus dining halls.  

We extract the nutrition information, as well as the dietary restrictions, for all offerings on a given day.  

This is then stored in a mySQL data base for later access.  

The database allows for the data to be subset to only offerings for a certain meal (e.g. Breakfast) from a specific dining hall (e.g. De Neve).

We generate meals from dining halls to meet caloric needs, with the goal of filtering for different diets, preferences, or restrictions.
